carpentR
================

This R Package implements a model from Stephen R. Carpenter’s 1992 \[1\]
[paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4612-4410-3_23) on predicting lake
algal blooms using plankton dynamics and other variables, and was
developed specifically for use in Sam Fey’s Ecology class at Reed
College.

The developmental version of this package can be installed with the
following code:

``` r
# install the remotes package (if you haven't yet)
# install.packages("remotes")

# install the carpentR package!
remotes::install_github("simonpcouch/carpentR")
```

Note that “original source code” is mentioned throughout this package’s
source—this is in reference to an original implementation of the model
in Pascal.
